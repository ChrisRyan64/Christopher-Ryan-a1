CP1406 - Assignment 1 - Project Plan
<br><br>
Name: Christopher Ryan
<br><br>
Goals
<br>
The goal of this site is to increase the number of volleyball players at Slammers, focusing on those aged between 15-30
<br><br>
Success Evaluation
<br>
For this website to be successful, volleyball players each week must rise from its current 100 by at least %50, to sit at 150 players.
<br><br>
Target Audience
<br>
Groups of young adults aged 15-30 who enjoy casual socialization. Must be willing to work in a team and be of good sportsmanship.
<br>To cater to this audience I kept the site navigation straight-forward and simple. Each option is clearly labeled. I used font to try and convey a casual feel, and chose colors to compliment this effort. It is these effects that I believe will be effective at drawing attention of younger adults.<br><br>
