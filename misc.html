  <h4>More About the Game</h4>

	<p id="moredetails">
	 	Volleyball is a team sport played by two teams on a playing court divided by a net. 
		The sport originated in the United States, and is now just achieving the type of popularity in the U.S. that it has received on a global basis, where it ranks behind only soccer among participation sports. There are 800 million players worldwide who play volleyball at least once a week.<br><br>
		Volleyball is a sport that is safe, fun and does not require extreme fitness. Since you don’t have to move around the court too much, it’s great for people who want a low-impact sport that will help them get fit without pushing them to their limit. For those who are a bit more competitive, the sport is fantastic because games can be really exciting and intense, but there’s always a net between you and your opponents.<br><br>
		Beach volleyball is suitable for people of all ages, and men and women alike. It's also good for making new friends as the smaller teams allow for more interactions than larger scale sports.
		Anyone considering starting a new sport or exercise program should see their doctor first.
